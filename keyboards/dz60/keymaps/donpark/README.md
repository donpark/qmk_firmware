HHPoker (*Happy Hacking Poker*) is a hybrid keymap that
combines best of Poker 3 keymap with HHKB keyboard layout
because I have several DZ60 PCB based board as well as HHKB and
found that slight differences in layout made switching keyboard annoying.

To use this keymap, you'll need a PCB, like DZ60, that supports *split-Backspace* and *split-Right-Shift* like this:

## Mappings:

```

FN + IJKL = Up, Left, Down, Right
FN + quote = Delete
FN + space = Backspace

```

`FN + quote` and `FN + space` are optional but
I like being able to backspace or delete without moving fingers off home row.

On HHKB, I remap the keys to use Control instead of FN using Karabiner Elements on macOS because
I don't use Control+IJKL for anything.
